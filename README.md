# Facial Detection Debiasing using Disentangled Representation Variational Autoencoder (DB-VAE)

## üìú Abstract

This project explores the use of Disentangled Representation Variational Autoencoders (DB-VAE) to mitigate demographic biases (e.g., based on race, gender, age) often present in facial detection systems. By learning disentangled latent representations, the model aims to separate sensitive attributes from identity-related features, leading to fairer and more robust facial detection performance across different demographic groups.

## üéØ Motivation

Standard facial detection models trained on biased datasets often exhibit significant performance disparities across demographic groups. This can lead to unfair outcomes, exclusion, and reinforcement of societal biases when deployed in real-world applications like surveillance, access control, or photo tagging. This project aims to address this critical issue by developing a debiasing technique based on disentangled representation learning.

## üß† Approach: DB-VAE

We employ a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) architecture specifically designed to encourage disentanglement in the latent space. The core idea is:

1.  **Encoding:** An encoder maps input face images to a latent distribution.
2.  **Disentanglement:** Techniques (e.g., Œ≤-VAE, FactorVAE, DIP-VAE, or custom DB-VAE modifications) are used during training to encourage specific latent dimensions to correspond to distinct, interpretable factors of variation (like identity, pose, illumination, and crucially, sensitive attributes).
3.  **Debiasing:** By identifying and potentially nullifying or controlling the latent dimensions corresponding to sensitive attributes, we can reconstruct or analyze faces based primarily on identity features, reducing the influence of the sensitive attribute on the downstream task (facial detection).
4.  **Facial Detection:** The disentangled representation or a reconstructed image can then be used as input to a facial detection model, which is expected to show more equitable performance.
